# Ohua JVM integration

Adapter for ohua and the JVM

## Installation

This uses the eta compiler.
Therefore both the compiler and the etlas project management tool need to be installed.

- initialize a sandbox with `etlas sandbox init`
- add the core as a source repository with `etlas sandbox add-source <path to ohua-core>`
- install the dependencies with `etlas install --dependencies-only`
- build with `etlas build`
